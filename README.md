    What to improve!--> I made it fairly responsive equally across various devices via/on Codepen (http://codepen.io/ap1341/pen/jrOKWv) I believe but need to still make my buttons work on codepen when viewing project via phone!
    -->Also, weird how buttons work when viewing this https://apalm1341.github.io/PersonalPortfolio/ via phone (or at least, iphone 6) but everything becomes condensed/smaller and squeezed in to the left hand side of page and being cut off!
